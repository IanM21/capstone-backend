- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IanM21/capstone-backend
cd capstone-backend
```

2. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses three main tables:

1. **users**: Stores user account information
   - id, username, password_hash, email, phone, first_name, last_name, created_at, last_login

2. **auth_tokens**: Manages authentication tokens
   - id, user_id, token, created_at, token_expires

3. **profile**: Contains user profile details
   - id, user_id, bio, profile_pic, age, location, interests (array), courses, school, created_at

## üîç Debugging

Common issues and solutions:

- **CORS errors**: Make sure the backend CORS settings include your frontend domain
- **Authentication errors**: Check that your JWT token is being properly sent in the Authorization header
- **Profile image upload issues**: Ensure the image is smaller than 1MB and is a supported format (JPEG, PNG)
